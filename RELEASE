This is golib 0.5
-------------------


IMPORTANT NOTE FOR VERSION 0.2.1:
---------------------------------
Version 0.2.1 is not for public use. I have to remove some things that
are sponsored by a company and they don't want the code to be released to
the public (I tried to convince them though, but it was fruitless).
If you accidentally got this version of the library (see the ending of
the libGo file: libGo.so.0.2.1 is the non-public version), remove it
immediately. Remove all parts of it. Thank you!
