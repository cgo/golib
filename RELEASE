This is golib 0.5
-------------------

Plans 
---------------------
TODO:
- Change license to "free only for research and private use"
  - Alternatively, call GPL version "free edition" or "GPL edition"
- Clean up the code, e.g. with respect to const usage
- Bug fixes
- Remove unused code (unused classes, functions, Siemens/DA stuff)
- Make the rest of the code usable
- Guile: add operators to guile code (see guile/swig documentation 
  for how that works)
- Documentation: more examples and tutorial-like introductions to the 
  modules
- Add cblas support for matrix and vector operations                    --- partly done
- Simplify matrix access for linearly stored matrices                   --- done, replaced old goMatrix
  - Measure time penalty for overhead of using goSignal* classes here   --- not done yet, seems to be huge though
(- Make it compile under Windows)

IMPORTANT NOTE FOR VERSION 0.2.1:
---------------------------------
Version 0.2.1 is not for public use. I have to remove some things that
are sponsored by a company and they don't want the code to be released to
the public (I tried to convince them though, but it was fruitless).
If you accidentally got this version of the library (see the ending of
the libGo file: libGo.so.0.2.1 is the non-public version), remove it
immediately. Remove all parts of it. Thank you!
