Preliminary license for golib
-----------------------------

You are not allowed to use this library in the context of any commercial
product without prior written consent of the author(s), currently Christian
Gosch.

I am not yet totally sure about this topic, maybe this library will be GPL'ed 
or LGPL'ed. Until then, you may use the library FOR NON-COMMERCIAL PURPOSES ONLY,
but you have to 
report changes you make on it to me, the author, and you may not redistribute 
a changed version of the library.
You may, however, redistribute the source 
unchanged as a whole, including all documentation including this text and 
all README files eventually included, with NO CHARGE. If you distribute a 
binary version, you have to include the source as a whole again, including 
all documentation and all other files included in the original distribution. 
No version of goLib may be distributed for a fee or charge, except some small 
fee for copying the library on a storage medium, like a CD or a floppy disk.
