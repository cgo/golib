/**
 * @brief Discrete "curve partitioning" after Latecki et al.
 *
 * What this class does is actually removing the
 * "least significant" or "least relevant" points from a digital curve.
 * The relevance is measured as in Longin Jan Latecki's convexity rule paper:
 * L.J. Latecki & R. Lakämper 
 * Convexity Rule for Shape Decomposition Based on Discrete Contour Evolution 
 * Computer Vision and Image Understanding, 1999, 73, 441-454
 *
 * @note This is not a fast implementation. It does not sort the points, but searches for the minimum
 *       in each step (it's experimental and may be dropped, that's why I didn't put too much effort
 *       into it).
