Please see the HTML documentation in doc/html
for current build and installation instructions.

Installation with CMake
=======================
Create a build directory and use cmake from there, e.g. 
 mkdir build
 cd build
 ccmake .. or cmake ..   (do whatever cmake wants you to do)
 make
 make install

See the README file for extra things you need and also
check the html documentation, which is probably much more up to date
than this file.
You can create the HTML documentation using doxygen, simply by calling
 doxygen
in the golib base directory.
The documentation should then be located in doc/html.
See there also for prerequisites.
